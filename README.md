Challenge # 9 - Surf's Up

## Overview of Analysis
### W. Avy is considering opening up a surf shop in Oahu, Hawaii. The purpose of this analysis is to determine if the weather conditions in Oahu are condusive to setting up a business on the island by looking at the average temperature.  If successful, this analysis could be expanded to include additional weather stations in order to determine other possible locations in which to expand the surf shops. 

## Results of Analysis
### 
- Temperature differences between June and December:
  -   mean temperature 3.85F warmer in June
  -   maximum temperature is 2F warmer in June
  -   minimum termparture is 8F warmer in June
-   Overall the temperature differences between June and December are not significantly different, indicidate that it would be feasible to operate the surf shop year round,           especially considering the additional potential customers that come to Oahu in from colder climates for a winter vacation.  

## Summary of Analysis
### When considering opening up surf and icecream shops on Oahu, based solely on temperatures reported by the weather stations on the island and precipitation, the conditions appear favourable for year round operation.  Oahu enjoys fairly consistent temperatures year round, with June ranging from 64F to 85F, and a mean temperature of 74.94F.  December also enjoys favourable temperature conditions ranging from 56F to 83F, and a mean temperature of 71F.  As the difference in mean temperature between December and June is only 3.85F, Oahu appears to be suitable for the year round operation of a surf and icecream shop.  It would be recommended to study the weather conditions of other nearby islands to determine the suitability of expanding.
